to the page for the rossmoyne rshs robotics club documentation


## Reasons you may want to contribute:

#### 1: docs build system broke (master and unstable not updated)
Reasons for this: the `EISVERYGOODLETTER_PAT` (organisation secret) expired. The `EISVERYGOODLETTER_PAT` is a secret that contains a personal access token (PAT) which can be used to access this repository. It becomes invalid every 30 days, and must be updated with a new PAT.
What to do: Open an issue
